Instructions
======================================================================================
This folder includes instructions for the calculation of g-factors at the DFT and GW levels according to 
Phys Rev Research 2, 033256 (2020).
The calculation procedures are very simple and you may find that some parts of this algorithm, code or script are not effecient.
You can change these accordingly after you have understood the purpose of each step.

Please note that an updated approach to incorporate self-energies into the calculation of the g-factors is presented in our recent paper
- npj Computational Materials, 7, 198 (2021). 

1) DFT level using QuantumESPRESSO-6.1

Our target is to calculate the orbital magnetic moment defined in Eq. (10) of Ref [Phys Rev Research 2, 033256 (2020)], where du/dk is evaluated as in Eq. (12):
<du/dk|x[Hk-Enk]|du/dk>
|du/dk> = (exp^{-i theta}|k+q> -|k>)/q
exp^{i theta} = <k|k+q>/|<k|k+q>|

So we need to calculate the DFT wave functions at K+qx, K+qy, K (K is the point at which g factor will be evaluated)

You can read "QuantumESPRESSO_codestructure.txt" to get a better understanding how QE works and why we modifiy c_bands.f90 
Do the following to get the g-factor:

   a, Set k list in the QE 'bands' calculation input: K+qx, K+qy, K. (qx = qy = 0.0001 or 0.00001)
      (be careful that in this step we need this parameter to be high    conv_thr = 1.0d-10)

      K_POINTS crystal
        3
      0.333353333  0.333323333  0.000000000   1.0
      0.333333333  0.333343333  0.000000000   1.0
      0.333333333  0.333333333  0.000000000   1.0

   b, Modify PW/src/c_bands.f90, which is the subroutine that controls the calculation of the k list in input. Set 'iiiv' to be the band index. Compile QE.
      remember to set qx in c_bands.f90 according to the input k list.
      the modification of c_bands.f90 is very simple. Just calcualte du/dkx and du/dky first and then evaluate <du/dk|x[Hk-Enk]|du/dk>
   c, Run pw.x < in > out.   In the "out", the g factor and Berry curvature are output for band "iiiv" at "K".


2) GW(COHSEX) level using QE-6.1 and BGW- (> = 1.2)

The strategy is straight forward. Just use the GW Hamiltonian and quasiparticle energies in <du/dk|x[Hk-Enk]|du/dk>.
<du/dk|x[Hk(GW)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> = <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> + <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk> 
The second term is reduced to:
2Im <du/dkx |[Sigma-Vxc]| du/dky>

   a, Prepare WFN and WFNq. Perform the standard GW calculation to get Enk(GW). 
      calculate <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> using the QE code (remember to replace Enk with GW values in c_bands.f90)
   b, Prepare a WFN_kkxky.h5. Be careful that the k-list order is different here : K, K+qx, K+qy

      K_POINTS crystal
        3
      0.333333333  0.333333333  0.000000000   1.0
      0.333353333  0.333323333  0.000000000   1.0
      0.333333333  0.333343333  0.000000000   1.0

      remember after pw2bgw, transform the BIN format to hdf5 format by: wfn2hdf.x BIN WFN.complex WFN_kkxky.h5.
   c, Prepare a WFN_after_C(V)BM.complex using python script 'writedudk.py'. 
      This script replaces the wave function coeffecient of band index 13 and 14 band at K by du/dkx and du/dky.
      the readin WFN_before.h5 is on the standard GW coarse grid (12x12 for TMD with subsample for example)
      13 14 is for TMD where VBM = 13. For other materials, change it accordingly.
      Set ib to be Valence and Conduction band in 'writedudk.py' to get WFN_after_C(V)BM.complex.
      (ib = 12 for valence and 13 for conduction, this is due to python array start from 0)
      You may run the python script as :

./writedudk.py WFN_kkxky.h5 WFN_before.h5 WFN_tempout.h5 WFN_after.h5 > CBM_write.out
rm WFN_tempout.h5
mv WFN_after.h5 WFN_after_CBM.h5
hdf2wfn.x BIN WFN_after_CBM.h5 WFN_after_CBM.complex

      Be careful that in the output ' CBM_write.out' there is normalization factor at the end.
      We use this to normalized the du/dk and we will need to take it into account in the final step of 2Im <du/dkx |[Sigma-Vxc]| du/dky>

   d, Perform offdiag calculation using BGW for 2Im <du/dkx |[Sigma-Vxc]| du/dky>. 
      link WFN_after_C(V)BM.complex to the WFN_outer
      remember to get back the normalization factor, since du/dk has been normalized. We need the origianal du/dk.
      The GW g factor is then obtained by summing the two contributions in the equation:

<du/dk|x[Hk(GW)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> = <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> + <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk>

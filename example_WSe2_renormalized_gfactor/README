This is an example for the calculation of monolayer WSe2 intrinsic and renormalized gfactor for valence and conduction band at K, using the GPP approximation for self-energy.

The intrinsic g-factor, using the GPP approximation to the energy depedence of the self-energy, is calculated in a similar way as the static COHSEX g-factor, which is shown in example_MoS2_inputOnly.
Basically we need to calculate g^intrinsic = <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> + <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk>
The first part "<du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk>" can be calculated using our modified QE code "c_bands.f90" with the GW quasiparticle energy.
The second part "<du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk>" can be calculated using the "outer corrections" flag in BerkeleyGW package where we put the du/dk in the WFN_outer.

The renormalized gfactor, which includes the dynamical effect from the QP self-energy, is defined in the Eq 8 of "npj Computational Materials, 7, 198 (2021)".

Detail instructions is listed below:

1) First we calculate the intrinsic g factor, with GPP approximation of quasiparticle self-energy:

a, Perform SCF calculation
   QE/01-scf/
b, Calculate the wave functions needed in a standard GW (GPP) epsilon and sigma calculation.
   QE/03-wfnqs/
   QE/parabands/
c, To calculate <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk>, we first calculate the wave function at K, K+dkx and K+dky and save it to "WFN_kkxky.h5"
   QE/04-dudk/
   wfn2hdf.x BIN wfn.complex WFN_kkxky.h5
   cp WFN_kkxky.h5 ../04-outer-normalized/
d, Construct the outer wave functions (du/dk) using "WFN_kkxky.h5" and the python script "writedudk.py" (for conduction band) and "writedudk_V.py" (for valence band)
   QE/04-outer-normalized/script.sh
   After this step We will obtain WFN_after_CBM.complex and WFN_after_VBM.complex, and link them to 08-sigma-outer/WFN_outer 
e, 08-sigma-outer/
   scissors2eqp.x 08-sigma-outer/WFN_outer 0 0 0 0 0 0
   mv eqp.dat eqp_outer.dat
f, Peform standard epsilon and sigma (GPP) calculation (using the WFN file from QE/03-wfnqs and QE/parabands).
   07-epsilon/
   08-sigma/ 
   (the sigma_hp.log file from this step will be used in the renormalized g-factor calculation.
    The GW energies will be used in the next step.)
g, run QE/04-gfactor-DFT with the new GW(GPP) eigenvalues to get : <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk>
h, 08-sigma-outer/script.sh
   check the outputs:CBM_sigma_hp.log VBM_sigma_hp.log 
   These are to obtain: <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk> (remember multiply back the normalization factor from QE/04-outer-normalized/C(V)BM_write.out)
   Use these results together with the results from step-g, we get intrinsic g-factor

g^intrinsic = <du/dk|x[Hk(GW)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> = <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> + <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk>


2) Next, we calculate the renormalized g-factor

g^intrinsic / g^renormalized = 1 - d Sig(E) / d E

The output file, "sigma_hp.log", in the standard sigma calculation step in 08-sigma/ contains the quantity, Z_nk, which is defined as

Z_nk = (1 - d Sig(E)/dE)^(-1) 
(see Eq. 44 of PhysRevB 34, 5390 (1986))

This is an example for Monolayer WSe2 intrinsic and renormalized gfactor for valence and conduction band at K, using the GPP approximation for self-energy.
The intrinsic and renormalized gfactor is defined in the Eq 8 of "npj Computational Materials, 7, 198 (2021)".

1) First we calculate the intrinsic g factor, with GPP approximation of quasiparticle self-energy:

a, Perform SCF calculation
   QE/01-scf/
b, Calculate the wave functions needed in a standard GW (GPP) epsilon and sigma calculation.
   QE/03-wfnqs/
   QE/parabands/
c, To calculate <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk>, we first alculate du/dk and save it to "WFN_kkxky.h5"
   QE/04-dudk/
   wfn2hdf.x BIN wfn.complex WFN_kkxky.h5
   cp WFN_kkxky.h5 ../04-outer-normalized/
d, Construct the outer wave functions using "WFN_kkxky.h5" and python script "writedudk.py" (for conduction band) and "writedudk_V.py" (for valence band)
   QE/04-outer-normalized/script.lsf
   We will obtain WFN_after_CBM.complex and WFN_after_VBM.complex, and link them to 08-sigma-outer/WFN_outer 
e, 08-sigma-outer/
   scissors2eqp.x 08-sigma-outer/WFN_outer 0 0 0 0 0 0
   mv eqp.dat eqp_outer.dat
f, Peform standard epsilon and sigma (GPP) calculation (using the WFN file from QE/03-wfnqs and QE/parabands).
   07-epsilon/
   08-sigma/
g, run QE/04-gfactor-DFT with the new GW(GPP) eigenvalues to get : <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk>
h, 08-sigma-outer/
   check the outputs:CBM_sigma_hp.log VBM_sigma_hp.log 
   These are to obtain: <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk> (remember multiply back the normalization factor from QE/04-outer-normalized/C(V)BM_write.out)
   Use these results together with the results from step-g, we get intrinsic g-factor

g^intrinsic = <du/dk|x[Hk(GW)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> = <du/dk|x[Hk(DFT)-Enk(GW)]|du/dk> + <du/dk|x[Sigma-Vxc]|du/dk>


2) Next, we calculate the renormalized g-factor

g^intrinsic / g^renormalized = 1 - d Sig(E) / d E

where "d Sig(E) / d E" can be found in the output file "sigma_hp.log" in the standard sigma calculation step in 08-sigma/.
